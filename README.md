## Community Development

This version of PoE Overlay was forked on 2020-06-10 to snapshot the app before it was
converted to closed source.

In order to avoid version confusion with the official version, we should do the following:

1. Any changes from the point of divergence should begin with version v0.7.0
2. Major releases may continue to v0.10.0 and beyond
3. Version should never reach or exceed v1.0.0 to avoid conflicts

## Developer

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

Your editor of choice for a node project - like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The first thing to install is [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download your matching executable and follow the instructions.

Then you need to install the [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe. This may take a while (10-15min).
```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Installing

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Open up the folder with your editor.
3. Run ```npm install``` to install all required npm packages.
4. Run ```npm run electron:rebuild``` to generate a executable [robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs) version.

That's it. Your Project should now be ready to run:
```
npm run start
```

### Running the tests

These are used to test for eg. the external APIs (poe.ninja, etc.). To run those:
```
npm run ng:test
```

#### And coding style tests

These will run certain linters to keep the project in a clean state.

```
npm run ng:lint
```

### Building

A electron executable can be generate by calling:
```
npm run electron:windows
```

### Built With

* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - The desktop app framework
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) - A component framework
